#Fluffy Palm Tree 🌴

## Overview
**Fluffy Palm Tree** is a small educational C++ project demonstrating a simple banking system.
It is designed to showcase clean project structure, object-oriented programming, and CMake-based builds.

The project simulates basic bank operations such as:
- account balance initialization
- deposit
- withdrawal
- balance display

This repository is intended as a **portfolio project** and a foundation for more complex backend or banking simulations.
